# Extension Icons

The Chrome extension requires the following icon sizes:
- icon-16.png (16x16)
- icon-32.png (32x32) 
- icon-48.png (48x48)
- icon-128.png (128x128)

These should be placed in the `/icons/` directory for the extension to work properly.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or copy the existing PWA icons from the client/public directory if available.
